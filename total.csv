                        At first glance, the all new Olympus TG-Tracker looks rugged and compact, easy to carry and easy to shoot. But there's far more here than meets the eye. That's because TG-Tracker is part of the Olympus Tough Family - worry-free cameras built to handle abuse so you can concentrate on getting great shots. TG-Tracker is waterproof to depths of 100 ft (30m), crushproof up to 220 lbf (100kgf), shockproof from 7ft (2.1m), freezeproof to 14F (-10C), and dustproof. Most other action cams need protective housings. That means more stuff to carry around, clumsy camera operation, and a difficult time capturing sound. With TG-Tracker, no housing equals better overall performance.
For adventurers looking to analyze their activities, switch the TG-Tracker to LOG mode to record the data from the camera's built-in GPS, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, and barometer. The location data from these sensors, such as location, altitude, direction, and temperature, can be viewed on the camera's monitor and downloaded for later use with the Olympus Image Track (OI.Track) mobile app.

                            Intel Virtualization Technology allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.

Intel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.

Idle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.

Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.

Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.

Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.

                                Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

The Electribe sampler is a sample-based production machine that lets you construct beats at maximum speed. You can freely edit and resample using waveforms that you've loaded and preset samples. Modulation and effects can be controlled easily just by turning knobs on the top panel. In addition, a variety of input interfaces optimized for inputting rhythm, bass, or melody allow you to smoothly create sequences as fast as you can think. The sequences that you create can then undergo additional evolution on stage or in your laptop. You can enjoy intuitive live performances that link various devices with the Electribe sampler, or utilize this capability for full-fledged music production by exporting sequence data to Ableton Live for detailed editing and final mixing. 

The latest system version 2 adds a much-requested pattern chain function that will be a great asset for live performances or music production. The lineup has also become more colorful with the new metallic red model. And we've also provided bonus patterns that reveal even greater sonic potential. Making your beat-making ideas rapidly take shape. It's the Electribe sampler; a sampler + sequencer that's thoroughly optimized for speed.

The Electribe sampler is a sample-based production machine that lets you construct beats at maximum speed. You can freely edit and resample using waveforms that you've loaded and preset samples. Modulation and effects can be controlled easily just by turning knobs on the top panel. In addition, a variety of input interfaces optimized for inputting rhythm, bass, or melody allow you to smoothly create sequences as fast as you can think. The sequences that you create can then undergo additional evolution on stage or in your laptop. You can enjoy intuitive live performances that link various devices with the Electribe sampler, or utilize this capability for full-fledged music production by exporting sequence data to Ableton Live for detailed editing and final mixing. 

The latest system version 2 adds a much-requested pattern chain function that will be a great asset for live performances or music production. The lineup has also become more colorful with the new metallic red model. And we've also provided bonus patterns that reveal even greater sonic potential. Making your beat-making ideas rapidly take shape. It's the Electribe sampler; a sampler + sequencer that's thoroughly optimized for speed.

                             HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor:
                            The official marketing text of HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor as supplied by the manufacturer

                            Intel Virtualization Technology allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.

Intel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.

Idle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.

Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.

Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.

Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.

The ECO750UPS standby green UPS offers complete protection from blackouts, brownouts and transient surges. Supports green energy savings via built-in ECO outlets that automatically power off unused computer accessories like printers or multi-media speakers when the computer is not in use. Full load efficiency rating of 99% also offers energy-savings and cooler operation by limiting UPS power consumption to less than 5 watts! Eco-friendly design meets strict RoHS environmental standards.  How the Energy-Saving Feature Works:Green Outletâ¢ technology saves up to $50 on annual energy bills by cutting power to designated energy-saving outlets when the master device (e.g. TV, computer) is turned off, preventing idle devices from wasting energy. Other outlets remain powered to support devices that operate continuously, such as DVRs, routers and broadband modems. Provides uninterrupted transition to battery-derived AC output during brownouts and power failures with enough runtime to save and shutdown connected equipment without data loss. Offers complete protection in an ultra-compact desktop or wall-mountable housing. Includes 6 battery supported outlets for computer, monitor and four vital system peripherals, plus 6 additional surge suppression-only outlets for accessories not requiring battery support. USB port enables UPS configuration options and unattended system shutdown without data loss in the case of extended power failure.  PowerAlert software is available via free download from the Tripp Lite website. USB cable included. Built-in single line RJ11 phone suppression protects modem, fax machine, cordless phone or other accessories with a dialup/DSL phone connection. Built-in audible alarm and front panel LEDs offer continuous status information regarding line and battery power operation. 750VA/450 watt power handling ability supports entry-level PC systems for up to 45 minutes during power fail conditions. $100,000 connected equipment insurance (USA, Puerto Rico, & Canada Only). â¢750VA power saving, ultra-compact GREEN UPS â¢99% line-mode efficiency saves energy and operating costs â¢4 built-in ""ECO"" outlets save power by automatically turning off connected accessories when the computer is not in use â¢Includes HID-compliant USB port, single line TEL / DSL line surge suppression, space saving right-angle input plug and six surge-only outlets â¢Input: NEMA 5-15P (120V 15A) / Output: 12 NEMA 5-15R (120V) â¢3 year product warranty / $100,000 Ultimate Lifetime Insurance"" "

                            Intel Virtualization Technology allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.

Intel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.

Idle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.

Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.

Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.

Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.
